Housing Price Prediction Using a Machine Learning Pipeline


ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for housing price prediction using regression. The dataset is based on publicly available housing data, and the model predicts median house values based on various economic and structural features.

ðŸš€ Project Workflow
Dataset Selection & Import â€“ Load and explore the dataset.
Data Visualization â€“ Analyze feature correlations using heatmaps.
Preprocessing â€“ Handle missing values (if any), scale features, and split data into train/test sets.
Model Building â€“ Implement a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn pipelines.
Evaluation â€“ Assess model performance using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² Score.
Deployment â€“ Upload the project to GitHub for version control and collaboration.


ðŸ“Š Technologies Used
1. Python
2. Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)
3. Seaborn, Matplotlib (Data Visualization)
4. Scikit-learn (Machine Learning & Pipeline)
